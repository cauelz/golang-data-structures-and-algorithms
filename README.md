## Introduction

This repository is aimed at documenting and exploring various data structures and algorithms in Golang. It serves as a practical guide for anyone learning or looking to refresh their knowledge on how to implement these fundamental concepts in Go.

## Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Maps
- Heaps

## Algorithms

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
